Preservers of balance and nature's warriors, the druids aid their party members by using great support spells,
as well as heavy damage dealing ones. They speak the language of the flora and fauna,
as well as they can shapeshift into a wide amount of beasts for combat or situational purposes.

Circle of Dreams (Xanathar's Guide to Everything)
These druids have a link with the Feywild. They were either trained there or gained access to their powers for some reason.
Their powers are mostly associated with rests, conformity and well-being, while also used to travelling through dreams or conjurating fey magic.

Circle of the Land (Player's Handbook)
Druids of this circle associate themselves to the land they were trained in, these being the arctic, desert, coast, forest, etc.
By attuning to these regions, they can learn different spells, as well as benefits associated with the chosen place.

Circle of the Moon (Player's Handbook)
Masters of the wildshaping ability, these druids fully understood how to use the best aspects of the beast they transform into.
Circle of the moon druids can wildshape into even more powerful beasts than the normally available opening to them a great world of possibilities.

Circle of the Shepherd (Xanathar's Guide to Everything)
Want to wreak havoc like Snow White or Aquaman do in their movies with the help of their animal companions?
Circle of the Shepherd druids commune with the spirits of nature in a similar way the totem barbarian does.
They get to choose an animal they are associated with as well as control or summon beasts to fight by their side.

Circle of Spores (Guildmaster's Guide to Ravnica)
Fungi and spores are vital for nature, and these druids find fascination within them.
Life and death are nothing but cycles that everything must go through.
This is why druids from this circle have a conflicting view in comparison to the others regarding undeath.
They believe it is just another step in the cycle, that as long as it does not provoke a danger to it all, it should keep on 'living'.

Circle of the Stars (Tasha's Cauldron of Everything)
Druids from the stars' circle are able to become one with the night sky. They carry star maps they themselves carve that serves as a guide.
Once ready to transform, they can become beings made out of constellations, stars, and the night sky, with the changing constellations granting different abilities.
The archer constellation is used to attack from afar, the chalice to better heal near allies, and the dragon constellation to become more cunning and intelligent.

Circle of Wildfire (Tasha's Cauldron of Everything)
Sometimes destruction is necessary for a sane recovery, just like forest fires serve a purpose in nature.
Thatï¿½s what these druids are all about. Wildfire druids channel the blazing fire energies from spirits of nature to create great destruction or heal with its warmth.
These spirits of fire can be used in battle to move allies across the battlefield, as well as to attack enemies and heal when they become nothing more than a small dying flame.
